Hey, I'm Kun-Ting, a PhD candidate at Monash University, working with [Tim Dwyer](https://ialab.it.monash.edu/~dwyer/), [Kim Marriott](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/kimbal-marriott), and [Benjamin Bach](https://www.designinformatics.org/person/benjaminbach/). I work at the intersection of Information visualisation (InfoVis) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), researching and developing human-centred interactive visualisations that help people explore complex data. 

My thesis concerns 2D visualizations using 3D metaphor for interactive wrapping of data visualisations on cylinder, torus, or sphere geometries. I explored various algorithms for optimising arrangements of network structures that aide user comprehension about the relationship within the data. Through user experiments I compared usability and effectiveness of this method over standard visualisations. I also performed user experiments with eye trackers, which I analysed and visualized user eye tracking data to identify user strategies when using the visualisations. I believe interactive visualisations have a potential to play a greater role in many other applications such as software or social network applications if we can present complex information to people in an understandable and engaging way. In addition, I'm also interested in future foods and their power of engaging people in the data exploration beyond visualization through multisensory interaction.

Before joining Monash University, I was working as a software engineer in [MSI Global](https://msi-global.com.sg/) (2017-2019) and [Land Transport Authority](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en.html) (2015-2017), an agile Scrum player and device owner of Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) software, developing and maintaining AFC software in use in production for bus and MRT systems in Singapore, Bangkok, and Manila. The enthusiasm and significant software development skills allowed me to work with teams to successfully deploy the software applications system-wide in more than 50 Skytrain stations and depots in Bangkok Mass Transit System ([BTS](https://www.bts.co.th/eng/)).
